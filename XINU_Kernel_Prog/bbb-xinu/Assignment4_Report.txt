				ASSIGNMENT 4

Functions of Assignment 4:

1. future_get(future *f, integer *value): This function will fetch the value from a valid future object and assign it to the 'value' pointer. If the future is empty, this method will block until the
future has been set with a value. Subsequent calls to a waiting future object would error out.
2. future_set(future *f, integer *value): This function will fetch the value from the 'value' pointer and assign it to the future value. The future state is then made valid. If the future was in waiting 
state, this function would signal the process , once the value has been assigned. This function would error out, if the set is called on a valid future.
3. future_alloc(int future_flag):  This function allocates memory for a future instance. Returns OK signal upon successful allocation and SYSERR upon failure.
4. future_free(future *f):  This function frees memory for a future instance. Returns OK signal upon successful deallocation and SYSERR upon failure.

As all the functions are system calls, we have implemented  interrupt processing in all the functions.
