	ASSIGNMENT - 2 SOLUTIONS

1. Does your program output any garbage? If yes, why? 
Ans: Yes the program prints garbage for higher values of input count value. The reason for this is because of lack of synchronization between the producer and the consumer process.
Since both the producer and consumer prints to stdout parallely without any synchronization, garbage values are expected.

2. Are all the produced values getting consumed? Check your program for a small count like 20.
No, not all the produced values are getting consumed. For a count of 20, only 17 values are getting consumed by the consumer.

The various functions include:
1. Producer(): The producer runs for count number of times and assigns the value of count to the global variable.
2. Consumer(): The consumer runs for count number of times and the value of global variable is decremented in each iteration.

Validations:
1. Checks if the argument for the prodcons command is a numeric value. If not, it throws an error with the appropriate advice.
2. Checks if there are more than two arguments are input for the prodcons command. If so, it throws an error.

Tasks developed by team members:

Amish Shah - Developed function Producer() and Validation No. 1 
Atul Mohan - Developed function Consumer() and Validation No. 2
